This is Songlin Jiang (he/him) from China. I am now studying at Aalto University in Finland for the first year of my master's degree, SECCLO (Security and Cloud Computing), an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master program. I am also granted the full-ride scholarship (26/767) that covers all my tuition fees and living expenses. I have completed 40 credits with a GPA of 5 for my first semester, where I learnt about knowledge related to multimedia services, scalability, cloud software and systems.

I am interested in software development, DevOps, and software testing. I can code in many languages and have project experience in Python, Javascript, Java, Android, C++, Rust, and HTML. I also have had many hands-on experiences in these areas before. 

Aside from the projects on my CV, https://github.com/HollowMan6/NFC-Android is an Android app for a ticket system, it also includes a cloud backend and management system. https://github.com/HollowMan6/mdbook-pdf is a backend for mdBook written in Rust for generating PDF based on headless chrome and Chrome DevTools Protocol.

I believe I'm the best suited for Igalia Coding Experience program for the following reasons. Aside from the experience and skills that I show on my CV and above, as well as the match in technology stack, I'm an experienced open-source contributor with 1.5k followers on GitHub (@HollowMan6), so I understand the best way to collaborate with others. Moreover, I'm a consistent person. I became an openSUSE member due to my excellent and continuously developing and maintenance work, even after Google Summer of Code 2021 ended. I'm also giving my promise that the work and the relationships built during the internship will be long-lasting. Suppose I luckily get selected by a project. If needed, after the internship, I can continue contributing.
